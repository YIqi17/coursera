            <h1>Apple</h1>
            <p>"An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus pumila). Apple trees are 
            cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree 
            originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. 
            Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North 
            America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many 
            cultures, including Norse, Greek and European Christian traditions."</p>

            <h1>Banana</h1>
            <p>"A banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry[1][2] – produced by several kinds of large 
                herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.[3] In some countries, bananas used for cooking 
                may be called "plantains", distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in 
                size, color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch 
                covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe."</p>

            <h1>Strawberries</h1>
            <p>"The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria × ananassa)[1] is a widely grown hybrid 
                species of the genus Fragaria, collectively known as the strawberries. It is cultivated 
                worldwide for its fruit. The fruit is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright 
                red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or
                in such prepared foods as preserves, juice, pies, ice creams, milkshakes, and chocolates. 
                Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in many products like lip 
                gloss, candy, hand sanitizers, perfume, and many others."</p>
